# Blending Station Android app

A [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) shell that packages the static site (Blending Station and
TankLabel) as an Android app, so labels can be printed on thermal printers through
[@devlas/capacitor-thermal-printer](https://github.com/devlas-cl/capacitor-thermal-printer).

The site at the repository root stays build-free and keeps being served by GitHub Pages as is.
`npm run copy:web` copies a snapshot of it into `www/`, which Capacitor bundles into the APK.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- JDK 21 (the one bundled with a recent Android Studio works)
- Android SDK with platform 36 (Android Studio installs it on first sync)

## Commands

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run sync          # copy the site into www/ and update the Android project
npm run open          # open the project in Android Studio (run / debug from there)
npm run build:debug   # sync and build android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Run `npm run sync` after every change to the site, before building.

## Label printing

In the app the TankLabel "Stampa BT" button prints through the plugin instead of Web Bluetooth,
which the Android WebView does not provide (see `tanklabel/native-print.js`). It sends the same
TSPL packet used by the web version over:

- **Bluetooth classic (SPP)**: the printer must first be paired in the Android Bluetooth settings.
  Printers that only speak Bluetooth Low Energy are not supported by the plugin.
- **USB OTG**: Android asks for permission to use the printer at the first print after it is
  plugged in.

The first print opens a picker with the paired and connected printers; the choice is remembered
and can be changed with the "Stampante" button.

### Patched plugin

`npm install` applies `patches/@devlas+capacitor-thermal-printer+0.8.0.patch` (patch-package).
Version 0.8.0 of the plugin asks only for `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, but it calls `cancelDiscovery()`
before every Bluetooth print, which needs `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` on Android 12+. It also asks for those
runtime permissions on Android 11 and older, where they don't exist and are always denied. The
patch fixes both. Drop it once a plugin release includes the fix, and update the pinned version.
Reported upstream in [devlas-cl/capacitor-thermal-printer#1](https://github.com/devlas-cl/capacitor-thermal-printer/issues/1).

## Reports, exports and system printing

Downloads, `window.print()` and the Web Share API don't exist in the Android WebView. In the app,
`native-app.js` (at the repository root, loaded by both pages) fills the gap through
`@capacitor/filesystem`, `@capacitor/share` and the app's own `PdfPrinterPlugin`:

| Button | In the app |
|---|---|
| Blending Station: Scarica PDF, Scarica immagine, CSV export | Android share sheet (save to Files or Drive, send) |
| Blending Station: Stampa | Android print dialog with the PDF report |
| Blending Station: Stampa WiFi, Registro, Sequenza | Share sheet, through the `navigator.share` the pages already use |
| TankLabel: PDF, Immagine, Stampa WiFi | Share sheet |
| TankLabel: Stampa | Android print dialog with the label PDF |

The print dialog uses the print services installed on the phone (Wi-Fi printers, "Save as PDF").
In the browser `window.NativeApp` stays undefined and every button keeps its web behaviour.

## Icons and splash screen

The launcher icons and splash screens are generated from the sources in `assets/`, which are
rendered from the logos in `../assets/`:

```bash
npx @capacitor/assets generate --android
```
